ðŸ§¹ Cleaning up Costume Scheduler project...
ðŸ“¦ Simplifying patch system...
âœ… Cleanup complete!
ðŸ“‹ Recommendations:
  1. Review README.simplified.md and replace the current README.md if you approve
  2. Use the new patch_manager.sh instead of multiple patch scripts
  3. Run './patch_manager.sh clean' to remove old patches
  4. Consider using a proper version control system like Git instead of custom patching

Run the app with: python3 backend/app.py
